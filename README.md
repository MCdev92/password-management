# password-management 📝🔒

Fullstack password management web application built on Python using "Flask" for the backend and "ReactJS" for the frontend. This is a personal project that I use to help me securely store my passwords. This project uses SQLite as a relational database to establish the connection port from the SQLite application to the flask application.
